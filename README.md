# IsoTV

IsoTV is Snakemake pipeline to analyze and visualize functional features of translated transcript isoforms. IsoTV incorporates various tools to predict protein domains, secondary structure, disordered regions, and post-translational modification sites. The visualization facilitates comparison of the set of transcript isoforms expressed across conditions and explored the functional consequences of isoform differences.
